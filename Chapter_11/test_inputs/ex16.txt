Here is a short story about a girl living on the moon:

My name is Luna and I live on the moon. I've lived here my whole life in our 
domed colony. My parents were some of the first settlers to come here over 50 
years ago. They tell me stories of what Earth was like - the blue skies, the 
oceans, the trees and animals. I've only ever seen these things in videos and 
books. To me, the moon itself is my home.

Every morning I put on my spacesuit and go outside to help collect samples and 
maintain the equipment. The dome filters in rays from the sun, but it's still 
special to stand under its light directly. Sometimes I look up at the blue and 
green marble hanging in the black sky and try to imagine what it would be like 
to walk under its open skies. 

My best friend Astra and I often explore the craters and jumps across the lower 
gravity areas. We like to imagine that we're the first ones discovering these 
places. After our chores and lessons each day, we play games in the underground 
caves. My favorite is when we pretend to be early space explorers, daringly 
going where no one has gone before, not knowing what we'll find.

One day I hope to actually visit Earth. But for now, I'm happy being a moon 
girl, with the solar system at my doorstep. My family and friends are here and 
the dome keeps me safe. The moon will always be my first home.

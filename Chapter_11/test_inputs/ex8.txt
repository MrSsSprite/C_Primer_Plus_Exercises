The printf utility formats and prints its arguments, after the first, under control of the format. The format is a character string which
contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences which are
converted and copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.

output
Since the floating point numbers are translated from ASCII to floating-point and then back again, floating-point precision may be lost.
(By default, the number is translated to an IEEE-754 double-precision value before being printed.  The L modifier may produce additional
 precision, depending on the hardware platform.)

may be l
The strchr() function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to a char) in the string pointed to by s.  The terminating null
character is considered to be part of the string; therefore if c is ‘\0’, the functions locate the terminating ‘\0’.

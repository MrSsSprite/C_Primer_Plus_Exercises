Here's more of the story about the girl living on the moon:

Luna has never been to Earth, but she's curious about it. Sometimes she gazes through a 
telescope pointed at Earth and tries to imagine what life there is like. She sees the blue 
oceans and green-brown land masses mottled with clouds. At night she locates the bright, 
sprawling cities glowing on the dark side of the planet. What would it be like to walk 
under an open sky that goes on forever instead of a confined dome? To be surrounded by 
billions of strangers instead of a close-knit colony? 

Her friend Astra is less enchanted with Earth. "Why would you ever want to go there?" she 
argues. "We have everything we need right here." Astra prefers the order and safety of 
colony life. Every person contributes meaningfully. No one is anonymous. Leaving the moon 
would be scary for her.

But Luna knows in her heart that one day she will make the journey. She wants to feel 
ocean spray on her face, dig her toes into sand, and hike through a forest under a blue 
sky. She imagines herself visiting all sorts of new places, trying foods she's only read 
about, and meeting people from all walks of life. To make her dream a reality, Luna 
studies intently in her Earth skills classes, learning languages, geography, and Earth 
customs. She's determined to be prepared for anything life on our strange, beautiful 
planetary neighbor has in store.

For now, Luna keeps Earth close through her telescope. The day of her journey will come 
someday. But the moon will always be her first home, calling her back.
